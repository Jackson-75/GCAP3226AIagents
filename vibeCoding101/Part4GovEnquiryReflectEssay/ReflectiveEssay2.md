# Reflective Essay 2

In this reflective essay, I review my experience drafting a government data enquiry and collaborating with an AI assistant. This process deepened my understanding of data governance in Hong Kong.

I found that while some government datasets are openly accessible, others require a formal request. The data websites are well-organized, making it easy to find most information. However, writing a formal enquiry letter still required me to clarify my research purpose and specify the requested data. This improved my professional communication skills.

The AI agent was helpful for organizing simple tasks and structuring my letter, but I realized I cannot rely on AI for everything; critical thinking is still essential. The AI did improve my efficiency by providing quick feedback.

Access to official data will strengthen my project analysis. If my request is denied, I will send a revised enquiry and also search for information online or in the library. This experience taught me to be flexible and resourceful in research.
