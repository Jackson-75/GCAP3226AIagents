# Reflective Essay 2

As a member of Team 1, my project focuses on the effectiveness of influenza vaccine promotion in Hong Kong, aiming to analyze policy interventions, resource allocation, and future trends. In this reflective essay, I review my experience drafting a government data enquiry and collaborating with an AI assistant, which deepened my understanding of data governance in the context of public health policy.

I found that while some government datasets related to vaccination are openly accessible, others require a formal request. The data websites are well-organized, making it easy to find most information for our analysis, such as vaccination rates and policy documents. However, writing a formal enquiry letter still required me to clarify my research purpose and specify the requested data, especially when evaluating whether the government uses data-driven decision-making in vaccine promotion. This improved my professional communication skills.

The AI agent was helpful for organizing simple tasks and structuring my letter, but I realized I cannot rely on AI for everything; critical thinking is still essential. The AI did improve my efficiency by providing quick feedback, which was valuable for tasks like drafting requests and summarizing findings for our regression analysis and scenario simulation.

Access to official data will strengthen my projectâ€™s analysis of policy effectiveness and resource allocation. If my request is denied, I will send a revised enquiry and also search for information online or in the library to ensure our research on influenza vaccination can progress. This experience taught me to be flexible and resourceful in research, especially when working on data-driven policy evaluation.
